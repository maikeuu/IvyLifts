     This class encapsulates the algorithm that will determine progress
        1. Take in personal records (Dependency Inject Personal Records)
        2. Calculate 1RM from personal records (Brzycki Formula (1RM = weight * (36 / (37 - r)))
        3. Generate fitness goals from those 1RM numbers (For every ORM, look at the session requirements and generate fitnessGoals for each day)
        4. Determine based on entries whether or not to progress
        5. Read from entries, have some sort of pub-sub/observer pattern notify when a session has been finished
        6. Progress accordingly if requirements have been met
